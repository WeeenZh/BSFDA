# Bayesian Scalable Functional Data Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of BSFDA (Bayesian Scalable Functional Data Analysis) proposed in the paper "Integrated Model Selection and Scalability in Functional Data Analysis through Bayesian Learning".

## Installation

The packages can be installed using conda and pip through the following commands:

```conda create -n {a_new_environment_name} python=3.9```

```conda activate {a_new_environment_name}```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Example
****
The following code shows how to run the proposed method on the simulated data. It typically takes about 10 minutes to run on a laptop.

```python -u ./code/example.py```

# Reproduce the results in the paper

The commands to reproduce the results in the paper are in the file ```./code/cmd.sh```.
